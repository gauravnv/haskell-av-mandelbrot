# haskell-av-mandelbrot

## Project Proposal

This is a project to test the feasibility of Haskell to build an audio-visual file that maps audio to the visualization of [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).  

### What is the problem?

The idea is to create multiple Mandelbrot Sets by iterating over different continuous parameters and generate images (or frames) that can be stitched together to create a video. 

### Something cool/extra

Mapping audio to each iteration of the Mandelbrot Set such that each frame of the video has a representative sound (not necessarily unique).
